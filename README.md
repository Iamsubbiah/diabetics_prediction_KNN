🩺 Diabetes Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
📝 Project Description:
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes, based on medical features such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, age, and more. The model is trained and evaluated on a medical dataset (like the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset).

By standardizing the data and applying KNN, the model compares each patient to similar cases to make accurate predictions. Evaluation is done using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix to understand the model's performance.

🧠 Tech Stack:
Python

Pandas & NumPy – for data handling

Scikit-learn – for modeling and metrics

📊 Workflow:
Load and explore the dataset.

Preprocess data: handle missing values and standardize features.

Split into training and testing sets.

Train a KNN classifier.

Evaluate using:

Accuracy Score

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

🎯 Outcome:
The project demonstrates how KNN can be effectively used in healthcare to make simple yet powerful predictions by learning from similar past patient data.
